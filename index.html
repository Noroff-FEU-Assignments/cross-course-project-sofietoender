    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> <h1> Lack of good web security can have big consequences and range from loss of private account passwords to loss of credit card details. The most common threats is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

     <h1>1.HTTPS</h1> 
    <p> Configure the web server to use HTTPS instead of http. The difference between HTTP and HTTPS is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. 
        As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP and ensures that login credentials, cookies, POST requests data and header information are not easily available to attackers.</p>
      
       
     <h1> 2.Sanization of data</h1> 
      <p>To improve the security of a webpage, you should sanitize all user-originating data before it is displayed in the browser, used in SQL queries, or passed to an operating system or file system call.
        A well-known third party soulution is the sanitize-html package in NodeJS.</p>
       
      <h1> 3.Secure authorization and authentication</h1>
      <p>Authorization and authentication can be done manually but can be best achieved by using an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin, Okta, etc.</p>
       
      <h1>4.Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)</h1>
      <p>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration is an automatic process of integrating and delivering code to production. 
        Examples of CI/CD  tools are Github Action, Jenkins, Travis CI and Circle CI. 
        The benefit of using CI/CD is that any change that does not pass the security checks will be rejected and flagged for rework.</p>
